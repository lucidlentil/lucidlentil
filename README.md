Hi there, I'm Greta ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer based in Christchurch, NZ. 

I've recently been earning a qualification in full-stack development, but front-end will always have my heart ðŸ¤«

I'm currently working on honing my React.js skills in my free time - when assignments will allow it - and am keen on collaborating with other aspiring techies to help bring their visions to life!
